## Introduction

This is a very simple project to help first-time contributors easily participate and contribute to an open-source project and get more comfortable in using GitHub.

### Who can contribute?

**This project is for both developers and non-developers.**
Anyone can contribute to this project, whether or not you are a developer, as long as you want to contribute to an open-source project.
This is intended for complete beginners and also for those with a little more experience who want to make their first open-source contribution and gain more experience.

### How and what do I contribute?

It's simple, there's an already created template in the HTML file which has been marked where to start and where to stop all you have to do is to make a copy of the template and customize it with your own information. To contribute, read the [Contribution guide](contribution.md) to get an explicit guide on the whole process of contributing starting from setting up Github to creating a pull request. If you're an advanced developer and you want to take it up a notch, read the [Advanced Contribution guide](advanced-contribution.md) to get started.

Once your pull request is merged, the changes will be live on [Dev-Profiles](https://dev-profiles-gangadhararaoande.vercel.app). If you appreciate this amazing project, kindly leave a ‚≠ê by clicking on the star button on the top right.
